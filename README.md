## Social Buzz
Social Buzz is a fast growing social media platform with over 500 million users each month, over 100 000 contents everyday.
Up until this point, they have not relied on any third party firms to help them get to where 
they are. However there are 3 main reasons why they are now looking at bringing in external 
expertise (Accenture):  
1) They are looking to complete an IPO by the end of next year and need guidance to 
ensure that this goes smoothly.  
2) They are still a small company and do not have the resources to manage the scale that 
they are currently at. They could hire more people, but they want an experienced 
practice to help instead. 
3) They want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of 
their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on  
understanding how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big 
data.

This project examines Social Buzz datasets in order to deliver the following:
- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity
